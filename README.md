# Example-KG-Ecosystem

The purpose of this repository is to provide a framework for materializing a knowledge graph for (possibly) the first time. It vaguely follows the modular ontology modeling methodology. It is purposefully left vague to allow for some exploratory (guided) research.

## Possible Resources
* [Same Data; Different Model](https://the-praxis-initiative.github.io/comparative-ontology-modeling/sessions/momo/momo.html) -- the MOMo Tutorial follows very similarly to this repository's goal.
* [Introduction to Knowledge Engineering](https://github.com/kastle-lab/cs7810-intro-to-ke) -- this will probably be the most useful.
* [The Open KG Curriculum](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum) -- for possible educational material, although there are many missing articles, still.

## Expectations
